# Audio Files

Place your audio files here:

- `manic-ambient.mp3` - Ambient audio for the manic state (energetic, fast-paced)
- `depressive-ambient.mp3` - Ambient audio for the depressive state (slow, somber)

The website will work without these files, but adding them will enhance the immersive experience.

You can use royalty-free ambient music or create your own audio tracks that match the emotional states.
